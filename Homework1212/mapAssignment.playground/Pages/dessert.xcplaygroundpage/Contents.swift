//Write a method, topping that accepts [[String: String]] and changes the values associated with keys in the following ways: if the key "ice cream" has a value, set that as the value for the key "yogurt" also. If the key "spinach" has a value, change that value to "nuts".













//[“ice cream": "cherry”] -> [“yogurt": "cherry", "ice cream": "cherry”] [“spinach": "dirt", "ice cream": "cherry”] -> [“yogurt": "cherry", "spinach": "nuts", "ice cream": "cherry”] [“yogurt": "salt”] -> [“yogurt": "salt”]
